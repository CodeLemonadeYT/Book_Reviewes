FIRST IMPRESSION: 

1)Language of the book is simple (despite carrying some advance level stuff) alongside the way and sequence in which author introduces 
  new concepts. 
  This builds up the flow of reading smooth and we donâ€™t need to flip the book frequently to understand a term.

2)Each section is partitioned with a breif overview of upcoming section which improves clarity.

I'll tend to complete this book by next week and update my reviewes here.

Overall first impression has set the standards high. Within the first Chapter, each section has been crafted really well.
I'd recommend to read slow and firm as author has tried to justify each sentence he has writtn. Till now, I'd agree that 
this book has justified it's price. Costed about ~ INR 1300.
